Lightecho Stellar Oracle - Web app for testing the contract

Hosted by GitHub pages at https://bp-ventures.github.io/lightecho-stellar-oracle/

Features:
- Fetch prices directly from the deployed Oracle contract in Futurenet network
- Uses JS SDK to build and submit the contract invocation transaction
- Uses a Flask API to parse the result (due to a limitation on JS SDK)
